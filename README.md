# Cultural Heritage Protection

A decentralized application for secure and private management of cultural artifacts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on blockchain.

## üåü Overview

Cultural Heritage Protection is a blockchain-based platform that leverages FHE technology to protect sensitive information about cultural artifacts while maintaining transparency and accessibility. The system enables museums, collectors, and cultural institutions to register, manage, and share artifact data without exposing confidential details such as valuations, authenticity status, and provenance information.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

This project implements FHE to enable computations on encrypted data without decryption. Key benefits include:

- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Sensitive artifact data (ID, value, age, authenticity) remains encrypted on-chain
- **Confidential Computations**: Verify authenticity and compare values without revealing actual data
- **Granular Access Control**: Owners can selectively grant decryption rights to authorized viewers
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Expert authentication without exposing proprietary information

### Private Cultural Heritage Data Management

The system addresses critical challenges in cultural heritage management:

1. **Confidential Valuations**: Artifact values remain encrypted, preventing market manipulation
2. **Protected Provenance**: Ownership history tracked without exposing sensitive details
3. **Secure Authentication**: Expert verification without revealing authentication methods
4. **Access Audit Trail**: Complete transparency of who accessed what information and when
5. **Controlled Disclosure**: Owners decide exactly who can view encrypted artifact details

## üìã Key Features

### Artifact Registration
- Register cultural artifacts with encrypted metadata
- Categories: Paintings, Sculptures, Manuscripts, Pottery, Jewelry, Textiles, Archaeological items, Religious artifacts
- All sensitive data encrypted using FHE before storage

### Access Management
- Grant/revoke viewing permissions to specific addresses
- Purpose-based access tracking (Research, Exhibition, Restoration, etc.)
- Comprehensive access history logging
- Owner and curator privilege system

### Expert Certification
- Curator-managed expert certification system
- Certified experts gain special verification privileges
- Expert authentication without revealing verification criteria

### Privacy Features
- Encrypted artifact IDs prevent unauthorized tracking
- Confidential value assessments protect market integrity
- Hidden age data prevents forgery pattern analysis
- Private authenticity status until expert verification

### Ownership Transfer
- Secure ownership transfer mechanism
- Automatic permission updates for new owners
- Maintains encryption throughout transfer process

## üìñ How It Works

### Registration Process
1. Connect Web3 wallet (MetaMask)
2. Fill artifact details (ID, value, age, category, authenticity)
3. Data automatically encrypted using FHE before submission
4. Smart contract stores encrypted data on-chain
5. Owner receives full access permissions

### Access Grant Process
1. Owner/Curator selects artifact and viewer address
2. Specifies access purpose (research, exhibition, etc.)
3. Transaction creates access record and grants FHE decryption rights
4. Viewer can now decrypt and view sensitive artifact data
5. Access event permanently logged in access history

### Authentication Verification
1. Curator certifies expert addresses
2. Expert requests authenticity verification for artifact
3. FHE decryption request submitted to network
4. Decrypted result triggers AuthenticityVerified event
5. Verification status available to authorized parties
